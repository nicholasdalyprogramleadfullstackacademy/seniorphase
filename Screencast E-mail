Seniors!,

As your instructors mentioned, you will be creating a screencast of your project. A screencast results in a smooth and attractive demo during which no one has to "drive".

*Please upload your screencast by Sunday, October 20th, labled `1907-FSA-NY-WEB-FT-<Project Name>`.*

You can use a free trial of Camtasia 2.10.8 to record. Camtasia offers fade effects, text overlay, mouse pointer emphases, and the option to record from a mobile phone if you created a mobile app. Here is a link: 
https://gist.github.com/b17z/06b4a51e3cb22d1b196333b2d74d25d6. Here is an FSA video tutorial of Camsasia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zsz8OzsJrI


Some guidelines:

*1. Make sure you record in 1080p with your app fullscreen.* Zoom in to a size that your audience doesn't have to strain to see, keep your mouse still, use simple transitions, and prepare your text and type ahead of time.

*2. Don't put anything important in the bottom corners of your screencast.* We combine your screencast and demo day recordings into a nice video of your project. In this video we put the name of your project and a blurb along the bottom left corner and a picture-in-picture of your demo day presentation on the bottom right side, so anything you put in the bottom corners might get cut off. Here is a good example of this: https://www.fullstackacademy.com/student-gallery

*3. Put your project name, URL and team members names at the last few seconds of your video.* You can also put a photo of the team if you'd like. I have some from your social reps if you'd like. 

*4. After Launch Day, if you want to add voice-over narration contact me to schedule a time to record.* Some groups have had success with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcyUKVLsyNM and https://vimeo.com/129333742

If you have any questions or concerns at all please let me, Ben, or David know!
